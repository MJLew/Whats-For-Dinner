# Whats-For-Dinner
Android Application. Suggests food choices randomly based on database.

Not currently released on any app store. To install you can download the project and build it.

The database will save to the device's internal storage as a CSV. You can replace or update the CSV file in any way as long as it follows the same format.
This way anyone can easily modify their database in Microsoft Excel and reupload it to be used in the application.

If a mistake is made while editing the file and it no longer works, you can backup your data to a separate file, load a blank CSV file into the app and re-add the data again.
